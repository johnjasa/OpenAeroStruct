How to Contribute to OpenAeroStruct
===================================

.. note::
  This section will be expanded in the future.

OpenAeroStruct is an open-source tool, thus we welcome users to submit additions or fixes to the code to make it better for everybody.

Issues
------
If you have an issue with OpenAeroStruct, have a bug to report, or a feature to request, submit an issue on the GitHub repository.

Documentation
-------------
When you add or modify code, make sure to provide relevant documentation that explains the new code.
This should be done in code via comments, but also in the Sphinx documentation as well.

Pull requests
-------------
Once you have added or modified code, submit a pull request via the GitHub interface.
This will automatically go through all of the tests in the repo to make sure everything is functioning properly.
The main developers of OpenAeroStruct will then merge in the request or provide feedback on how to improve the contribution.
